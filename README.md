An implementation of the Lucas Lehmer isPrime function in JS

More details on Wikipedia: [Lucasâ€“Lehmer primality test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas%E2%80%93Lehmer_primality_test)

JavaScript is obviously not the best language if you want to prime-check large primes quickly, but I had fun implementing the algorithm in JS nonetheless.
